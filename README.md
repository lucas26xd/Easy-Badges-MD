## Easy creation of badges for readme.md
#### This quarentine project serves as a standardizer for readme.md from my repositories.

## âš™ Behavior
#### The operation of the application is very simple, you just have to indicate your profile and which repository on GitHub you want to generate the tags and click on the OK button.
#### The gif below exemplifies the generation of the tags for the [WhatsApp-Simple-Tools](https://github.com/lucas26xd/WhatsApp-Simple-Tools) repository, showing different customizations of them changing the colors, styles and quantity of tags.

## ðŸš€ Tecnologies
#### All the code was built in [Python](https://www.python.org/). How was my first experience with the library [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) I also used the support of the screen creator [QtDesign](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download).

## ðŸ”¨ Dependencies
#### The list of libraries and their respective versions are listed in the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
#### To install all dependencies you can use the following command:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer.

List of dependencies:
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/): Library for the graphical interface.
